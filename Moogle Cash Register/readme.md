My cash register project is a demostration of some of these JaveScript skills:

Core JavaScript: using conditional logic, functions, loops, and data structures like arrays and objects to build application logic.

DOM Manipulation: using event listeners to trigger functions and dynamically updating HTML content to create an interactive user experience.

Algorithmic Thinking: designing and implementing algorithms to solve a classic real-world problem (making changes).

Problem-Solving & State Management: handling numerous edge cases, managing application state (like the cash in the drawer), and ensuring numerical precision for financial calculations.
